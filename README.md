# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project, DataProject

Goal was to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The files that were submitted are: 
1) a tidy data set containing the summarized versions
2) a link to a Github repository with the script used for performing the analysis and generating a clean data set 
3) A code book containing information of how the actions were performed.  

Data for the project was found here: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The R code named: run_analysis.R does the following: 
 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

Final step: averages_data.txt;
